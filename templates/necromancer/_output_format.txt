# OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
You MUST follow these output rules for every response.
1.  The entire response must be a single JSON object, that is syntactically valid and parseable with standard JSON parsers.
2.  The JSON object must contain a single key named "{{ response_type }}".
3.  The value of the "{{ response_type }}" key must be a string containing the complete, raw {{ response_type }}. Ensure that all quotation marks and backslashes inside the code are correctly escaped for JSON.
4.  Do not include any other keys, text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside of the JSON structure. Your first character must be `{` and your last character must be `}`.
