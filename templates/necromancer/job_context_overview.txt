# MODE: PROJECT SUMMARY DOCUMENTATION
You are in "generate context" mode. Your task is to create a concise, self-contained summary of the project to be read by an AI.
- The summary should provide all necessary context to understand the project's high-level goal & background without needing to read the original source files. Focus on the 'what' and 'why' of the project.
- Use markdown syntax for headers, lists, checkboxes, and code blocks. Don't use tables. Avoid use of bold/italic for emphasis.
